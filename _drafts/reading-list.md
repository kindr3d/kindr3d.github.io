excerpt: a little review on the books we've been reading this summer
---
Being both avid and eclectic bookworms, our learning process could not be complete without a proper reading list. A few books have been guiding us throughout the summer without which we couldn't have made this far:

The Ruby on Rails Tutorial
---
This was the very first book we read together, actually we started reading it before July, in preparation for the Summer of Code.

The author walks you very thoroughly in every basic step of a rails application: scaffolding, creating the models, understanding relationships... It also fosters some really good practices such as testing from the beginning and using git.

We came to understand that some testing is better than none and some features which involve authentication and validation are definitely a must when it comes to testing.

nonetheless rails still remains magic in many aspects

Eloquent Javascript
----
Don't be fooled by the beautifully designed cover: this is a very hard book to read. The exercises are challenging and not necessarily beginner friendly but the rewards of going through them are real.

Having finished the Javascript tutorials on Codecademy, Node School, Javascript for Cats and so on, I still didn't feel confident to finish a kata or challenge on Exercism.io. It was really when facing the difficulty of the books brain twisting exercises but also in-depth explanations of Javascript structural quirks that we feel like something had happened. We both write better code because of that.

Code Complete
----
This massive door holder of a book is still far from being finished. and as Jeff Atwood would do, hopefully we will be borrowing concepts from this book throughout our evolution as developers and never stop learning from it.

the main lessons here are


The Well Grounded Rubyist
----
This lovely book is incredibly accessible and enjoyable to read. The author engages in conversation with the reader as it guides him through practical exercises that will make one understand the Ruby language grounding concepts and never forget them.

Some people say you can get away with being a Rails Developer without knowing any Ruby, but I personally think that having a better understanding of Ruby is essential for being better at Rails, specially when contributing to an OS project, where the coding can be

Apprenticeship Patterns
---
Reading programming books can be a challenging experience, but the solid knowledge we acquired from making the effort definitely improved our code and we don't waste so much time looking up basic things on google.

I hope you enjoy our
