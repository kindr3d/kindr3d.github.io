<p>
We are <strong>kindr3d</strong>, team from sunny Frankfurt am Main. Our goal this summer is to learn as much as our brains can contain and create beautiful and informative statistics visualisation for Discourse (If you don't know what <a href="https://www.discourse.org">Discourse</a>is you are missing out, go follow that link). We are interested in data (including books), all things web, feminism and food.
