title: First week conclusions

excerpt: It has been a week since we’ve started the program. On Monday, we got acquainted with our mentoring company Namics. Vincent dropped by at his old company to welcome us together with the other coaches. We had a really in depth conversation on the status quo of the industry and the what it means to be a programmer. Nino introduced us to ember and MVC thinking (and how no one seems to agree exactly how they relate). It was nice to see the level of involvement in everyone.

Namics people are lovely and the office is really welcoming: they made sure we get a seat right beside Max and Nino and we have unlimited amount of coffee and fruit at our disposal.

Our kick-off call finally took place on friday afternoon and everyone (including supervisor Max and mentor Robin) was at last united! As expected the call answered a lot of questions and put us back on the track.

Robin was kind enough to create a project curriculum to guide us through the summer. We also have plenty of community input from meta.discurse members. This is our plan for this week: setting up our own discourse database and playing around with it, as well as filling in the blanks in d3/ember knowledge via our sandbox/bookclub app. This should give us enough momentum and help identify the final scope of our work.
