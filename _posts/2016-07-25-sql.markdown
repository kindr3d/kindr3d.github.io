This week we are exploring the discourse database and learning about SQL. We did a little review on the most important things so far and made a cheat sheet:

![SQL Cheat Sheet]({{ site.url }}/assets/sql1.jpg)

![SQL Cheat Sheet 2]({{ site.url }}/assets/sql2.jpg)

We learned for instance, that $ can be used to form string constants in SQL to build monstrosities like

``` sql
$Here's what I call "having a good time"$
```
Our lives will never be the same again.
