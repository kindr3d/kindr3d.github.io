it’s time to celebrate and look back into our wonderful journey

First of all we are feeling very lucky to have those three month at our disposal for learning, communicating and building things. We suddenly became a part of the big community of people who care about each other and are ready to give their time to help someone else join them. It is very humbling to meet so many great and generous people.

Warm and fuzzy general feelings about the program
--------
* thankful for meeting each other and having gone through so much learning together
* empowered by other teams and stories
* having goals and great mentors and coaches helps you to endure the hard times
* frustration moments will eventually pay off


What we achieved with the project
---------
* confidence in our skills, beating imposter syndrome one book/kata at a time
* better understanding of our strengths/weaknesses within a team
* open source is all about community: writing code that is more empathetic, meaning that when writing we have to keep the people who will read/change it in mind.

We definitely wanna keep contributing and learning from open source
-------
* keep on motivating each other and learning together
* look for opportunities to go on learning : open source related jobs, scholarships like outreachy, internships,
* go to conferences together in november and december


Of course the world of Open Source is not just rainbows and unicorns, but we got very lucky and met a bunch of kind, generous folks.

Here is the long list of our thank yous!
------
* travis foundation and rails girls summer of code team for all the guidance and challenges that made us stronger and better coders
* our supervisor max for being an awesome guidance and the sweetest and chilled-out person
* our mentor robin for being so generous and patient while introducing us to such a complex and big project
* our coaches vincent, max and nino for bearing with us even when the hardest beginner questions arose
* namics for hosting us this summer and being a great welcoming home during those 3 months
* rails girls frankfurt and techettes for organizing the workshop that got us together for the first time and for your effort in creating a better community
* all the awesome people we met on the way on our trips and conferences
* diversity tickets and conference organisers for opening the doors to tech and showing how open and welcoming it can be.

Being a beginner is a paradox, one is always balancing lack of skills with enthusiasm. In our case we managed to get over many hurdles with the help of people around us: our coaches, mentor, supervisor and other women we talked to.
One has to accept that there are going to be disappointments, but in the only thing that matters is that we are much better developers (and humans) than 3 months ago.

This summer changed our attitudes to our own career, now we are not satisfied with just any job, but rather we want to continue giving back to OS community, we are looking for jobs which will allow us to do so and continue learning and improving.
