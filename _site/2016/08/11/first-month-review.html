<p>Oh, boy! One month has already passed!</p>

<p>Last week we had our monthly hangout with coaches, mentor and supervisor. Everyone seemed pretty happy with the progress, although we as a team still feel slightly underwhelmed by the lack of concrete results from our learning. Max and Robin encouraged us by saying that the pace was just right. In order to feel better about ourselves, we made a retrospect of the things we have done in July and indeed, much has been achieved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discourse
    <ul>
      <li>installation (which took us a really long time)</li>
      <li>existing report models and its JSON endpoint</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explored databases
    <ul>
      <li>SQL + Postgres</li>
      <li>Active Record (Conventions, Migrations, Associations, Query Interface)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>General Internet knowledge
    <ul>
      <li>HTTP requests / states</li>
      <li>JSON and serializers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We did a lot of learning on learning and we keep on reading regularly. We are currently going through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete">Code Complete</a> and have been getting some mind-blowing insights on software development process. Working in Namics has also been very enlightening.</p>

<p>Our current goals, which borrow from our mentors curriculum, are aimed on getting more code written:</p>

<p>First steps is to <strong>visualize JSONs with d3</strong> (a nice way to both go through javascript and graphic libraries), after that we need to <strong>identify the exact scope of our contribution to the admin reports module</strong>. Depending on that our workload will change (we also donâ€™t know if we have to actually come up with a redesign of the admin dashboard). From there we would move naturally to <strong>sending pull requests</strong> to the discourse project.</p>
