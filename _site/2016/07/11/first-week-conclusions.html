<p>It has been a week since weâ€™ve started the program. On Monday, we got acquainted with our mentoring company Namics. Vincent dropped by at his old company to welcome us together with the other coaches. We had a really in depth conversation on the status quo of the industry and the what it means to be a programmer. Nino introduced us to ember and MVC thinking (and how no one seems to agree exactly how they relate). It was nice to see the level of involvement in everyone.</p>

<p>Namics people are lovely and the office is really welcoming: they made sure we get a seat right beside Max and Nino and we have unlimited amount of coffee and fruit at our disposal.</p>

<p>Our kick-off call finally took place on friday afternoon and everyone (including supervisor Max and mentor Robin) was at last united! As expected the call answered a lot of questions and put us back on the track.</p>

<p>Robin was kind enough to create a project curriculum to guide us through the summer. We also have plenty of community input from meta.discurse members. This is our plan for this week: setting up our own discourse database and playing around with it, as well as filling in the blanks in d3/ember knowledge via our sandbox/bookclub app. This should give us enough momentum and help identify the final scope of our work.</p>
